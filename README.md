# Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this activity I built a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in Javascript. I wrote this program to learn about Array methods and also the alert(), confirm() and prompt() methods in Javascript. It helped me understand what a function is and how useful it can be.

## Usage

The game can be played by opening [Rock Paper, Scissors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) in Google Chrome.
